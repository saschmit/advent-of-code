# Advent of Code Solutions

This repo contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/events) for sharing with friends and family.

I know Python well, but I'm trying to learn Rust (off & on), so solutions will vary.

The lack of permissive licensing is deliberate -- I don't mind you looking at what I did, but solve the problems yourself.

I reserve the right to rebase/rewrite the repo contents at any time.  You shouldn't be building upon this anyway.
